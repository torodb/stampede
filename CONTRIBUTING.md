Contributing to ToroDB
=======================

ToroDB is open source, and as such we welcome any external contribution, in the form of feedback, testing, resources, documentation and, of course, code.
Pull requests are always welcome.

Please observe the following rules when contributing to ToroDB:

* Post to [ToroDB's developer mailing list][1] with any question or improvements about the source code, to keep the discussion organized within the mailing list.

* Contact us at toro at ToroDB dot com before sending a pull request, to have a contributor agreement signed with us. This is a requirement for your pull request to be merged upstream.

* Changes and pull requests should be performed from the ``devel`` branch, instead of ``master``. Please adhere as much as possible to the apparent style of the code you are editing.
